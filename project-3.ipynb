Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport).

I've got some coupons for restaurants in the mail on the first week - make sure to keep an eye on those. Another way to help transition from eating out more to cooking more is looking for preprepared proteins and healthy dips/sauces in the grocery store - they can save a lot of the mental energy of dealing with raw meat and really add flavor to a meal.\n",

They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options.

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them.

      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

In fact, freshman/sophomore research positions are rare apart from rare advanced candidates (taking PhD level coursework or starting with advanced courses from the get go) or disciplines that require a lot of grunt work (ex: natural science labs etc.) or with fewer technical skills (ex: humanities where you read and summarize/analyze documents)\n",

Also: they got lots of mails so sorting through generic cold emails becomes annoying. One thing you can do is to do well in courses and work on technical skills needed for your research area of interest (in your case statistical programming in R or Python) and take core classes that are helpful to research areas you are interested in.

Spread out evenly?  And if so, is it normal military tactics if there are less than a dozen dudes with small arms (being generous, maybe they kept moving between them and Israel just kept missing them over and over) in an apartment building full of 30+ people - to destroy the building and kill everyone inside.  2:1 tradeoff of civilians to militants a normal trade the american military would make?\n",

Since you are allowed to kill roughly 1-2 civilians for every dead soldier per Israeli targeting policy?\n",

This is necessarily  still a useful, likely is the best definition because it is the definition used by Netanyahu, Ben Gvir, and the Likud party.  As recently as this week they have shown maps showing their plans to seize the entire west bank for permanent Israeli settlement in full, and their language towards gaza has been of how to evict them so that israeli settlers can begin moving in.  That is practical, actual, in effect, real zionism in action.  That is what protesters are specifically talking about.  If we are attempting to be most understanding, a sticker like in the OP would be referring to the zionist soldiers who maybe killed a family member of theirs during one of the many mass evictions, much in the way a colonial american might have said \"Death to Redcoats!\".  Of course, too many people also use the phrase to mean \"average person who supports zionism but isnt actually firing the guns or passing the laws\" which is a problem, our whole goal in this discussion is to think how best we can get to a scenario where apartheid is over and civilians can live in peace regardless of their prior beliefs.

This small group of students decided they should make life for everyone on campus more miserable by not funding things like student organizations and the food pantry for people in need. If you are a student group trying to raise funds let's say stop the possible genocide that is happening in Sudan, you are shit out of luck because the students who got elected to CSG decided their causes and political ideology are more important than yours. So instead of supporting student organizations mostly equally, these radicals that got elected decided your family getting murdered in Sudan isn't a cause worth supporting over theirs.\n",

      "Now fortunately for us, these radicals that got elected are mostly larpers, who can barely show up for their classes and spend more time virtue signalling on Instagram and Twitter than doing actual productive work to support their cause. Thus so many of the radicals on CSG got procedurally replaced because they didn't show up enough to the CSG meetings. All they had to do was show up to these meetings and do nothing but really just sit there. But that was too much actual work for them because CSG has fixed meetings and these radicals have problems with time management.

The upcoming fall semester is also my 5th year (9th semester) at UMich. I am an international student who first came to UMich back in fall 2018. Up until first semester of sophomore year, I was maintaining 3.5 gpa, but during the winter 2020 semester when COVID happened, I was not able to focus on classes because of remote learning and ended up with multiple C's which were all luckily masked with P's, so no damage was done to my cgpa. Then I took 2 years of gap year to go back to my country for mandatory military service. I came back fall 2022 semester, but I was seriously burned out from serving and also getting back to an academic setting was very difficult transition for me. Although I was barely able to get above 3.00 gpa that semester, subsequent semesters I got below 3.00 gpa, and, ultimately, I got below 2.00 gpa the past winter semester, resulting in me being placed in academic probation. Back then, I would be upset with getting B's but now I don't really care even when I get C's and D's. I would also feel really anxious back then when I missed quizzes that didn't count towards final grades, but now I dont really give a shit about missing exams and quizzes (in fact I skipped all exams for one particular class and ended up with an E). I feel extremely devastated, and I have occasional lingering suicidal thoughts because of how much I screwed up college. I had nearly no friends throughout college and was never, ever socially active. I feel like crap when students around me are seemingly doing well academically and being active socially/making great college memories while I am stuck in my room most of the times not being able to focus on studying, wasting time on the internet, etc. My parents never know how much I am struggling in college, and I feel extemely guilty because they spent around $300k to send me here to study. I don't know how I can get out from this mess I've created and feel extremely angry/remorseful of all the wasted time and money the past six years. I hope you feel better and remember that there are worse people like me out there too. PM me if you want to talk to someone who's in the exact same but worse situatuon to you lol.\n",

The PhD GSI situation is rare but does happen. The university can't legally hire a currently enrolled student as a lecturer because it violates the collective bargaining agreement of GEO. You see it more often in the law, medical, and MBA programs where Phds are returning for a professional degree.

Some universities flat out refuse to do it and some require they be in drastically different disciplines.\n",

As with dealing with GSI or tough professors, the only advice i can give is to look at the syllabus and follow it to a T. If you follow that you should be fine.

I know people that do the exact opposite and wait till the last minute and dont plan anything and get 4.0 GPA but i feel like thats the exception not the norm as well as gifted students that can do that. Finally, be honest with yourself, if math is something you struggle with then take some more time doing practice math problems and not as much time in essay writing if essay writing is easy for you.

      "\n",
      "1. This resume kind of screams master of game dev. Assuming you're not applying for game dev roles (and considering you've sent 700+ apps I assume not), this resume is still way too focused on game dev. It's unclear what roles you're targeting (backend/frontend/fullstack/ml/etc.) You don't have to have a speciality or anything, but a kind of broad direction is good. Fullstack + ML? Frontend? etc. This again is indicated by the projects you choose to display & the bullets you use to highlight exp. You have 2 game dev projects + bullets that kind of seem, all over the place? You have 1 frontend exp + 2 game dev + 1 AR + 2 game dev projects. I'm not really sure what to get from this. If you're not targeting game dev roles I would replace your projects and select your bullets for those exps better. For example, pioneered an accessible, flexible, game engine\" is a good first bullet because it's broad enough, but the rest are useless. \"Developed 2d+ shaders\", \"Implemented A\\* pathfinding\", \"Engineered a scalable, modular enemy wave system\", \"Created RPG, RTS, and Tower Defense templates\" are frankly not good bullet points if you're not game dev. If a role is hiring for Backend SWE I don't care about any of the above. You're highlighting the wrong parts of your experience. Did you work in a team? Use cloud services? Highlight other parts of what you did. Same goes with bunch of bullets under other exp.\n",
      "2. The other glaring issue is that your bullet points don't follow STAR. Firstly, I don't see a single metric/result/statistic anywhere in your resume which is definitely not helping you pass screens. Secondly, I don't see the point in some of your bullets. For example, \"Streamlined source control via Bitbucket while engaging in global communication and collaboration\" is a really weak bullet among several. Another example is, \"Created responsive particle systems for an immersive experience, consistently testing to ensure functionality\". This barely tells me anything, and \"consistently testing to ensure functionality\" is not really something to be highlighting in your resume either. I would suggest cutting this and replacing it with something else altogether, or even a stronger rephrasing might be something like \"Integrated responsive particle systems using React, Node.js, [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) to enhance user experience, resulting in 50% increase in interaction rates\" or something. You want all your bullets to follow the format of \"Developed \\[xyz\\] to accomplish \\[xyz\\] using \\[x, y, z\\], resulting in \\[xyz\\]\".\n",
      "3. Smaller nit, but the formatting of your technical skills is kind of janky. You should stick to 3 lines, and there's no need for Advanced/Beginner.

You need to spend time on it anyway, why not work on it without the pressure?  Either you finish it quickly and don't have to stress, or you spend a while on it but you needed that time anyway.

It is normal for definitions to change with time (Republicans love talking about how they were the party of Lincoln despite the modern Republican party aligning more with the Democratic Party of that era), and by 1949, political zionism shifted considerably. Modern Israel was formed not as an ethnostate, but as a multicultural and mostly secular state with the state religion being Judaism. It’s similar to any European Christian country with a state church but one that also has a diverse population and allows anyone to serve in government/have any occupation independent of religion or ethnic background. Israel is actually the most religiously diverse country in the region, despite ~70% being Jewish. That composition is not consistent with an ethnostate, which would be something like Japan, China, or even the population of Gaza which is >98% Sunni Muslim.

From there my advisor pushed me to pursue an MBA (which i have one semester left and have increased my scholarship amount due to strong grades). Michigan may be your dream school, but it may not be the school for YOU. however, I wouldn’t make any changes if you only have one year left here. I doubt this message helps, but i think it helped me open about my past\n",

      "Error processing text: TLDR: Yes, the GSI selection criteria is opaque and there can be politics involved. Yes, sometimes the students that work hardest do not get the position while for some the opportunity drops into their lap without much effort. For better or worse, the GSI system is the way it is because the skills needed for the position are not the same as the ones required for being a good student or researcher. Soft skills are be vital and for small courses having a pre-existing rapport with the instructor matter as it helps the course operate more smoothly. Finally, the GSI positions are never guaranteed unless you are a PhD student and being a GSI a necessity for your funding. As others pointed out, keep working hard and eventually your efforts will be rewarded whether it is a GSI position with tuition waiver, a high paying industry job, or a good post-doc/tenure track position that fits your interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For better or worse, the politics are a necessary component of the process as in smaller/advanced courses**, GSIs are mostly autonomous and design the labs on their own. An instructor needs to be able to get along with the GSI, trust in their abilities, and be able to rely on them during emergencies (ex: professor is sick and needs someone to teach a class under short notice). It is not uncommon to see a professors own students get GSI positions for their class as usually the research areas overlap (i.e., if a student is focusing on experimental design and working with a professor working on experimental design, they might be shortlisted and given preference to teach an experimental design course). Furthermore, some professors want to keep the same GSI for the course to make the process easy or reward hard work (example: GSIs that design labs for a course might be preferred to give the course consistency and reward hard work of the GSI)\n",
      "2. **Soft skills are as important as hard skills for GSI positions.** GSIs teach material, head discussions, grade assignments, and are usually required to communicate with students. Under these circumstances, sometimes soft skills can take precedence over hard skills. You might outperform your peers in courses, in your research, and other fields but if they are better communicators, especially verbal communicators, they might be chosen over you as a GSI since depending on the course, most of the position is communicating. This is another reason why not every researcher makes a good instructor and vice versa. Some people are naturally better at explaining complicated concepts simply or captivate a room full of students or not loose their temper when students ask the same question 1000th time in the same office hour instead of paying attention to other students' questions. These skills can be acquired through practice, but just like sports there are some who are natural at this.\n",
      "3.  (**I am not sure if the OP is a masters or a PhD student) GSI positions are not a right, they are a privilege unless you are PhD student**. In US universities master's programs are usually cash-cows where students pay for a education credential, this is in contrast with Europe where master's programs are usually research focused, akin to first 2 years of a PhD program in US. Since master's programs generate revenue, most programs do not give GSI positions to master's students if they can help it. (GSI=tuition waiver=loss of tuition revenue). PhD students already have their education paid for so a tuition waiver is not a loss of revenue and depending on the department, most PhD students are required to GSI for a set number of semesters per their funding offer. Some get fellowships and GSRA positions instead of GSI positions but most are required to GSI. The specifics change between fields and departments but the point stands that PhD students have priority for GSI positions and they also have 1-on-1 relationship with professors as their advisors, committee members, co-authors etc. as such will always be in a better place to snatch the open positions\n",

      "\n",
      "I know there are protests against him.  I was very happy to see them, even if I know those protests are more against him than they are pro palestinian civilian.  But Bibi still won an election and his brand of Zionism is currently guiding israeli policy, from well before Oct 7 whether it was denying farming or well grants to palestinian settlements or restricting travel, to west bank settlements, to banning imported goods to Gaza, to sniping an american journalist and blaming it on Hamas until enough people called them out. Multiple pro palestinian americans have been killed by Israel.  No policy has changed as a result. \n",

      "\n",
      "Your brand of zionism may be different than his.  But it is his that comes from the original usage in 1899 and it is his that is tangibly guiding military movements today and his that is currently sending bulldozers to the west bank to flatten Jenin, and it is his that protesters condemn when they chant against zionism.  I ask that you understand that it is more important to know what someone means by the word than to get hung up on the word itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fully understand this is all a problem for jewish people who wish for coexistence.  Bibi is attempting to conflate his version of zionism with all zionism and further with all judaism such that he and his supporters can call anyone who criticizes him antisemitic, that if you ask him to stop killing children he can say you hate jews.  It is their stated goal and why they are pushing so hard to redefine words in their favor.  There is a reason Israel is the only foreign nation where US states will pass laws banning people from NOT working with them.  Bibi's brand wants to conflate political ideology with ethnicity and religion until they are inextricable. The tangible effect of that also goes in reverse, now anti jewish racists of both the classic nazi variety and also the modern anti israel variety attack random jewish people because they see them as representative of bibi brand zionism even though they are not - which is complicated when Bibi's brand of zionism will claim that they are.  Conflating an ethnicity with a political state is one of the most racist things you can do and Bibi brand zionism does it to itself. Arabs and sikhs in the US are well aware of this post 9/11 when they were all seen as Al Qaeda terrorists by large amounts of the country, we have a decade of weirdly racist TV shows as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of bibi's influence, now they have convinced places like colleges all around the country that they need to treat any student who says \"free palestine\" as antisemitic lest they themselves as a university be seen as antisemitic.  I regularly see social media posts where someone is pinging a business, like an airline, trying to get a flight attendant wearing a palestinian flag pin fired for being antisemitic, some airlines have even bent to that pressure. It's a horrifying loop that US liberals are engaging in that plays directly into the hands of Bibi brand zionism and strengthens it, not weakens it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again.  If there is a word or phrase two different groups use differently.  You can't judge them for saying the word using your definition when they are using it for their definition.  Rather than fight over the semantics of what words are and aren't allowed at a protest, perhaps a better option is to actually engage with the protesters and what their goals are.    At this point 8/10 democrats want to stop sending weapons to Israel, I believe it may even be a majority of americans total.  Not because they are antisemitic, not because they support hamas, but because Bibi brand zionism is genocidal, and he is using the lives of jewish people who are not his brand of zionism as a shield to protect himself, and the protest movement wants him to stop and just like the protesters in tel aviv who got skunk gassed, they want a ceasefire now.  Bibi does not want a ceasefire.  Nobody has any leverage over him except Biden and american businesses.  So it is our job to find a way to make that pressure effective.  And tone policing antiwar protests rather than, you know, joining them until the war stops, is not going to be effective.\n",

Lumping all political zionists together as one monolithic group makes as much sense as saying all Americans have the same politics and aims.

They pray facing Israel, their prayers are about Israel, their holidays incorporate plants indigenous to Israel and/or celebrate being in Israel/trying to get to Israel/defending Israel. Furthermore, Hebrew is part of Jewish culture (Jews use their Hebrew names in marriage certificates/ketubahs etc.) Spiritual Zionism is very much intertwined with the Jewish ethnic identity, and to stop being spiritually Zionist is to stop being Jewish. Spiritual Zionism has nothing to do with politics. I’d argue actually that the majority of American Jews know very little about political Zionism and historically haven’t paid much attention to the inner workings of a country half way around the world, but when they hear “Zionist” they automatically think “Jew” because of spiritual Zionism. \n",

If you open the floodgates to less qualified students, you either have to accept that there will be a lot of failing students or that the courses will need to be made less demanding. The former is terrible from the perspective of enabling your students to succeed, the latter is terrible because you now have less rigor and depth.\n",

My health was in shambles as was my finances, I even took a year gap during the worst of it. Pre-pandemic era I had a 3.6. I just graduated in December after 5.5 years with a 2.6 GPA and it was hard, miserable, and I’m still shocked I pulled though and finished. I had pretty much no internships, research or extracurriculars (excluding my housing cooperative). To get hung up on the what could have been’s will get you absolutely no where. I won’t lie and say I don’t wish I did better, because especially in this job market I wish I had. However I will say, I am employed doing something I enjoy that does use my degree, my health is intact, and I’ve found other things to base my worth on. The success culture at Michigan is so draining, I’m far away now and I still wake up some days asking myself “what the fuck am I doing.” And I can at least honestly say “what I wanted to do.” I’m in the process of starting a small business, keeping busy, and enjoying my friends and family. In the long run the last 6 years of my life I would never call a “failure”, I learned a lot. The future doesn’t look how I thought it would even 2 years ago but I’m honestly pretty happy with that. I’m sure our situations might be very different, or we have different goals, but I hope hearing from a recent graduate is somewhat comforting regardless.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Positives:** MFRM is a nice major that gives you a solid background in quantitative finance, especially with regards to pricing of financial instruments. It is a niche major (you are still a math major technically it is a concentration) but has a wide range of possible career prospects, with the most lucrative being quant finance where some get 6 figure salaries right out of college. Finally, the major has a lot of overlap with statistics (entire statistics pre-requisite and 425-426 theory requirement for statistics) and somewhat with economics (you need to take econ 101-02 and can count 401-402 distributional electives for the major) so double or even triple majoring is quite easy. Finally, the major feeds nicely into the AMDP program (Quantitative Finance and Risk Management for math track and Applied Statistics if you supplement it with statistics major)  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negatives:** That being said, when I went through the major (and I believe still currently) the major is really theoretical with a lot of fixed costs for taking any remotely applied course. Just to take MATH 423, a course primarily on pricing options, you need Math 115,116,215,217 and 425. Furthermore, most of your coursework is theoretical. This is somewhat an artefact of quantitative finance where the models are continuously refined (for example a ARMA-GARCH model with asymmetric and heavy tailed error distribution would be a considered simple even though non of the components of the model are trivial, especially estimation) and the field is very top heavy with a lot of math geniuses (ex: students taking PhD level coursework sophomores/juniors) or PhD holders dominating the field. This makes going through the AMDP track a near necessity if you want to go forward with a quant position in the industry. Finally, like all other math tracks, the coursework can get time consuming and difficult at times with a lot of variance due to most courses (in the math department, not the electives/requirements from other departments) being taught by post-docs that are here for 2-3 years (I had one or two courses during my entire major that were from full time faculty, rest were all post-docs). \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "**TLDR:** Financial math is an amazing major that provides a solid foundation for quantitative finance and economics as well as statistics. The major works well with economics and statistics majors, giving you flexibility to pursue either of them as a secondary major (even both to triple major!). The major has nice exits in terms of AMDP programs or industry but the coursework is really theoretical so you need internships or other advanced courses to supplement yourself in terms of applied skills. Finally, the coursework can be difficult but if you put time and effort to it you can succeed! Just do not overload your schedule with 5 courses and a half time job like me and truly digest the material.\n",

Also, the fact that at UM you pay \"threshold\" tuition (rather than per credit hour) means that you don't necessarily \"save money\" on the classes that you place out of, unless placing out of them actually shortens the number of semesters you pay tuition.  There may be other benefits but saying on tuition may not be one of them.

Polling opened for the regents at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday, and was open for around an hour. After polls closed, no update was given on the process until around 5:20, when it was announced that votes were still being counted. The next update was at around 5:50, ten minutes before the convention was scheduled to end, where an announcer said that the votes had been counted, and now the calculations had begun (votes are weighted by county in a process that was not and has not been completely disclosed to the public). Around this time, there were reports of several cop cars around the convention center, and multiple cops came inside to “make sure delegates left peacefully after the results were announced”. Finally, the announcer came back out on stage over an hour later (and an hour after the convention had ended) and announced the final tallies for each candidate, said that Illitch and Diggs won, then hurried off backstage.

So if Social Work hires one of their student to be a GSI, they can't just say \"oh, we'll just waive your tuition & fees and not collect the revenue\" because it's not all their revenue to forego.  They'd be taking revenue away from student legal services, from Law, from LSA, each of whom aren't gaining anything from the hire.

The only exceptions to this is if you are legally emancipated, orphan, married I think, and a few other things. Getting a job will not impact the aid you get based on your parents income lol. You need to read up on this in the student aid website and look into it for yourself. There’s a reason why so many people have issues with financial aid especially for the students that have been very independent and supporting themselves through their low incomes but aren’t able to escape their parents income which is what their aid is evaluated by. So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won’t support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not. And if this is the case for you, which it most likely is, I would look into getting better jobs off campus because the student employment typically doesn’t pay much.\n",

      "Error processing text: **TLDR: RA job doesn't compensate as well anymore and it is on the frustrating end for the average person. Since you already have a lease, you will have to deal with the sublease and loose money on that. I'd do a quick math on how much you can make working 10-15 hours a week (realistic RA hours) as well as 2 weeks full time before school in the summer (RA training) to see if that helps you pay your rent and food in your current living arrangement. Also: Do a sanity check in whether you are ready to deal with dorm BS that happens day-to-day**  \n",

      "**Workload**\n",
      "\n",
      "1) **Required workload of RAs is very much dependent on your hall director.** There was a trend during my undergrad days that housing upper management started requiring RAs to meet and log interactions with students but in the end your hall director decides on how much emphasis to give for that job. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) **How much work you do is dependent on yourself.** For the events you have to hold every month you can do simple things like board game night and tea hour in the lounges near your community with 0 effort or you can book a room to organize movie nights and get funding for popcorn etc. where you have to do more hands on work. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) **RA work on paper and actuality differs.** On paper you work 20 hours a week but in reality due to points 1 and 2 above your actual week to week work is much lower. There are a lot of unnecessary mandatory meetings that eat up time for RAs but you can sneak some course work into those or just zone out. \n",

      "**Compensation**\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the workload, RA compensation on paper is very different from the reality. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) On paper you are being compensated for a single room in a dorm with free dining, last I checked worth over 14,000 over 2 semesters (8 months). On a hourly basis, taking 20 as the baseline, this used to be roughly $22/hour. Back when average wages for on campus jobs like dining were $10/hour this was pretty good. Yet, nowadays with the increases to minimum wages across the campus ($15/hour, usually more), the pay differential is not as good. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The the hourly compensation is based on a single room and 20h/week work assumption but in reality, you should compare to other housing options you have (in this case, compare to what you can make outside of being an RA and compare it to your current lease and what you pay for food on average.)\n",

      "**Working as an RA**  \n",
      "RA positions can be frustrating since \n",
      "\n",
      "1) **the housing has this idea that every residents wants to have a older sibling relationship with their RA in reality most residents do not want to deal with their RA**, the person that has to write them up for alcohol, noise, etc. As such you have to fight an **uphill battle of trying to hang out with residents and get to know them well (as mandated by your job).** \n",
      "\n",
      "2) **If you are on duty you are waken up late at night** to deal with necessities like lockouts but mostly for immature stuff like light-drunk students playing their music too loud in their room or being loud in lounges as well as occasionally serious stuff (heavy-drunk students passing out or puking in public spaces and more) . You have to (not all RAs do this though) walk across the entire building and check bathrooms (can be time consuming depending on the size of the building) and finally have to **wake up early to return the phone they call.** \n",
      "\n",
      "3) **Housing management is incompetent and overbearing. There are numerous mandatory meetings that accomplish nothing**, the management comes up with stupid policies that make your job harder, and a lot of other annoying stuff are imposed on you\n",

      "Finally, working as an RA is something you will most likely remove from your resume after you graduate and get an adult job so it doesn't help you advance your career as research assistant or IA positions\n",

      "**A Big Positive: Easy to get Rehired**\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing is desperate for getting returning RAs to handle practical training so it is usually easy to get rehired. Most students RA as 3rd and 4th years so there is always large turnover nearly necessitating rehiring most RAs as long as they did not screw up bad. As long as you do a OK job, you have free housing until you graduate (especially good if you become a RA as a sophomore)\n",
